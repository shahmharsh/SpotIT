Parking Spot finder app

As a part of Yahoo! Q3 Hackday, implemented a Parking spot finder android app for Yahoo employees. The app keeps track
of available parking spots, and distributes them among polling users, creating a way to easily manage parking
infrastructure in Yahoo. Implemented the business logic on the backend using a vortex server.
